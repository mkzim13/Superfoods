# Superfoods Informational Brochure — Project Narrative

## Instructional Problem

The goal of this project was to create a concise, visually engaging informational brochure introducing parents to “superfoods” and offering practical strategies for incorporating them into family meals. While many parents are motivated to improve their family’s health, they often lack quick, accessible guidance on which foods provide meaningful benefits and how to prepare them in ways children will accept. The brochure aimed to bridge this gap by providing simple, actionable information that could be understood at a glance.

## Audience Analysis

### Primary Audience: Parents

Our primary audience consisted of parents seeking to improve their family’s nutrition. Through early audience analysis, we identified several key attitudes and constraints:

- **Optimistic and eager**, but often anxious about changing their children’s diets.
- **Time‑constrained**, requiring content that can be read quickly and applied immediately.
- **Budget‑conscious**, with limited ability to purchase rare or expensive foods.
- **Affected by food access**, including those living in food deserts with limited availability of fresh produce.

These factors shaped our design decisions. We prioritized readability, affordability, and practicality, selecting superfoods that were widely available and offering preparation ideas that required minimal time and skill.

### Secondary Audience: Children

We anticipated that parents might use the brochure as a teaching tool for their children. To support this secondary audience, we incorporated:

- Colorful, inviting visuals  
- Simple explanations  
- A layout that encouraged exploration  

This dual‑audience approach ensured the brochure was both informative and engaging.

## Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done Framework

Using a Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done model, we defined the overarching outcome as **“Promote the health of the family.”**

To support this outcome, the brochure needed to help parents:

- Learn which superfoods offer meaningful health benefits  
- Understand how to prepare and use these foods  
- Introduce superfoods in kid‑friendly ways  
- Teach children about healthier eating habits  

These jobs guided the content structure and level of detail.

## Instructional Problem Statement

To improve population health, we will provide parents with an informational brochure that:

- **Explains** the importance of incorporating superfoods into family diets  
- **Clarifies** the nutritional benefits of selected foods  
- **Offers** simple, practical strategies for preparing these foods in child‑friendly ways  

Our goal was not only to motivate parents to use superfoods, but also to equip them with the knowledge and confidence to do so effectively.

## Project Execution

### What Went Well

Several factors contributed to the success of the Alpha project:

- **A focused scope:** A tri‑fold brochure limited the amount of content required, reducing production and editing time.
- **Immediate access to the target audience:** Because we could easily reach parents, we received frequent, rapid feedback throughout development.
- **Early content development:** We drafted the content within the first week, allowing ample time for revision and refinement.
- **Integrated collaboration:** The editor and production specialist were involved from the beginning, eliminating the need for a formal handoff and enabling iterative improvements as the brochure took shape.
- **Canva:** Canva proved to be an easily 

### Challenges Encountered

Despite the overall success, we encountered several challenges:

- **Limited space for content:** Once graphics and layout elements were added, the available space for text decreased significantly. This required aggressive prioritization and concise writing.
- **Reading level constraints:** Achieving a 6th–8th grade reading level proved difficult. Even minimal scientific terminology raised the reading level, forcing us to simplify language further than expected.
- **Reference formatting:** We were unsure whether references were necessary in a brochure. Including them consumed valuable space and detracted from the visual design. In future iterations, a QR code linking to references would preserve credibility while maintaining aesthetics.

### Tools Used

We used **Canva** as our primary design and production tool for this project. Canva was easy to access, intuitive to learn, and well‑suited for creating visually appealing layouts with minimal setup time. Its built‑in templates, graphics, and formatting features allowed us to experiment with color, hierarchy, and visual balance without requiring prior design experience. A major advantage was Canva’s collaborative environment: all team members could access the project remotely and work concurrently, which streamlined editing, reduced handoff delays, and enabled rapid iteration based on feedback. Overall, Canva supported both the instructional and aesthetic goals of the brochure while facilitating efficient teamwork.

## Deliverable Overview

The final deliverable was a **two‑sided tri‑fold brochure** created using Canva. The front and back panels formed the cover and closing sections, while the interior panels presented the instructional content.

For each featured superfood, the brochure included:

- A brief description of key nutrients  
- A concise summary of associated health benefits  
- Simple, practical suggestions for incorporating the food into family meals  

The emphasis throughout was on **brevity**, ensuring the brochure remained approachable and easy to skim.

A small reference section appeared in the bottom corner of the interior panel. While functional, it crowded the layout, reinforcing our conclusion that a QR‑based reference system would be preferable in future versions.

## Reflection

This project highlighted the importance of:

- Designing within strict space and readability constraints  
- Understanding the real‑world limitations of the target audience  
- Balancing visual appeal with instructional clarity  
- Iterating quickly based on user feedback  
- Collaborating early and often with editors and production specialists  

Although the subject matter was nutritional rather than technical, the core skills—audience analysis, concise writing, layout awareness, and iterative refinement—directly align with professional technical communication practices.
